Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Sociology at Duke University.

For more information, see <https://www.tkeskinturk.github.io> and my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rPRZ-pMAAAAJ&hl=en) page. My CV is [here](https://tkeskinturk.github.io/assets/tkeskinturk-CV.pdf), if you need it.

If you have any questions about these or want to talk about research, feel free to contact me at <turgut.keskinturk@duke.edu>.
